# Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is used to create web applications.
# Flask>=2.2.5: Specifies that the Flask package is required, and the version must be 2.2.5 or higher.
# The >= symbol ensures that any version greater than or equal to 2.2.5 is acceptable,
# providing flexibility while maintaining compatibility with the applicationâ€™s code.

# Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) library that provides utilities
# for request and response handling, routing, and security.
# Flask relies on Werkzeug for many underlying operations.

# allowing Python code to interact with PostgreSQL databases. The -binary version includes
# precompiled binaries, making it easier to install but potentially less customizable than
# psycopg2 without -binary.
# psycopg2-binary: Specifies that the psycopg2-binary package is required, with no specific version constraint.
Flask-SQLAlchemy
#Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy (an ORM, or Object-Relational Mapper)
