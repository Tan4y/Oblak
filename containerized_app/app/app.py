from flask import Flask, render_template
# Flask: Flask is a micro web framework used to create web applications in Python.
# render_template: This function allows us to render HTML templates. 
# It will look for templates in a templates directory (by default) and pass any necessary data to the HTML template.

# psycopg2: This is a library used to connect to a PostgreSQL database in Python.
import psycopg2.extras 
# psycopg2.extras: This module provides additional tools for working with PostgreSQL,
# like custom cursor types.

app = Flask(__name__)
# app: Creates an instance of the Flask class. This app object is essential as it represents
# the application and is used to configure and define routes.

        # password: The password for the database user.

    # conn: This connection object, conn,
    # is returned by the function, allowing other functions to interact with the database.

# @app.route('/'): This decorator registers a URL route to this view function. In this case,
# itâ€™s the root URL (/), so visiting http://localhost:5000/ will trigger this function.

# index(): This function defines what happens when a user navigates to the root URL.

    # Creates a cursor object to execute SQL commands. By using DictCursor,
    # each row fetched from the database is returned as a dictionary,
    # allowing column access by name instead of by index.

    conn.close()
    # conn.close(): Closes the connection to the database, ending the session.

    # app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000): Starts the Flask web server:
    # debug=True: Enables debug mode, which provides helpful error messages
    # and enables automatic reloading on code changes.
    # host='0.0.0.0': Makes the app accessible to any IP address on the network.
    # port=5000: Specifies the port on which the app will listen for requests.
